      Hi my name is Luke Ragan, I am in my senior year at the University of Missouri - Kansas City and I am pursing a bachelors degree in computer science. I worked over the summer of 2023 doing research with the school and I currently work at Menards part time. After I graduate I want to work in AI or Cybersecurity working mainly with environmental companies or medical companies because I want to work for a company that has peoples lives as their priority.
